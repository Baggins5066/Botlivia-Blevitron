# Blevitron Discord Bot

## Project Status
âœ… **Memory-Driven Bot with User Profiles** - Bot generates personalized responses using conversation database + user profiles (Oct 21, 2025)

### Recent Changes (Oct 21, 2025)
- **âœ¨ NEW: User Profile System** - Local JSON file storage for personalized user personas:
  - **User-specific descriptions** - Define how the bot should interact with each Discord user
  - **Profile commands** - Easy-to-use Discord commands for managing profiles (`!setdesc`, `!profile`, etc.)
  - **Personalized responses** - Bot uses profile descriptions alongside conversation memories to adapt its behavior
  - **Local JSON storage** - Profiles stored in `user_data/profiles.json` (portable, editable, version-controllable)
  - **Profile context injection** - Automatically loaded when responding to each user
  - **No database required** - Works outside Replit, completely self-contained
  
- **ðŸ”„ Memory-Driven Architecture** - Bot synthesizes responses from database memories:
  - **Removed predefined persona/personality** - No hardcoded character traits
  - **Retrieves 40 relevant messages** for comprehensive context
  - **Memories framed as conversation history** - LLM generates responses based on patterns in past messages
  - **Author attribution included** - Each memory shows who said it: `[username]: message`
  - **Broader similarity threshold (0.25)** - Captures more contextually relevant memories
  - **Neutral decision logic** - Bot decides to reply based on engagement heuristics
  - System instruction includes user profile personalization
  
- **ChromaDB Local Storage** - File-based vector database:
  - All message embeddings stored locally in `chroma_data/` directory
  - 636 unique messages with 768-dimensional vectors and author metadata
  - No external database dependencies - fully self-contained project
  - Easy to back up, deploy, and version control
  
- **RAG Memory System** - Vector database with semantic search:
  - ChromaDB for local vector similarity search with cosine distance
  - Google text-embedding-004 for generating 768-dimensional vectors
  - Semantic search retrieves relevant past messages before generating responses
  - Bot has "memory" of 636 unique Discord conversations
  - Easy ingestion pipeline for adding more message history
  
- **Previous improvements**:
  - Fixed mention system using regex word boundaries
  - Added DM handling to prevent crashes
  - Migrated from PostgreSQL to ChromaDB successfully
  
- Configured for VM deployment (always-on background worker)

### Main Components
- **bot.py**: Core bot logic including Discord event handlers, message processing, and profile management commands
- **config.py**: Configuration settings and API keys
- **llm.py**: LLM integration for AI-powered responses with user profile context and comprehensive memory retrieval (40 messages)
- **user_profiles_local.py**: Local JSON file operations for user profile management (CRUD operations)
- **utils.py**: Utility functions for logging and smart user mention handling with regex
- **chromadb_storage.py**: Local vector database storage using ChromaDB with cosine similarity
- **memory_search.py**: Semantic search using vector embeddings, retrieves 40 messages with author attribution
- **message_parser.py**: Parser for Discord export text files to extract message content and author information
- **embedding_pipeline.py**: Pipeline to generate embeddings and store them in ChromaDB
- **migrate_postgres_to_local.py**: One-time migration script from PostgreSQL to local JSON storage
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies (discord.py, colorama, aiohttp, chromadb)

### Dependencies
- `discord.py` (v2.6+): Discord API integration
- `colorama` (v0.4.6+): Terminal color formatting
- `aiohttp` (v3.13+): Async HTTP requests to Gemini API
- `chromadb` (v1.2+): Local vector database for semantic similarity search
- `numpy`: Numerical operations for embeddings

### Environment Variables Required
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Discord bot authentication token
- `LLM_API_KEY`: Google Gemini API key for embeddings and responses

### Prerequisites
1. Set up the required API keys as environment variables:
   - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Get from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - `LLM_API_KEY`: Get from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Running the Bot
The bot runs automatically via the "Discord Bot" workflow. It will:
1. Validate that API keys are set
2. Connect to Discord
3. Load local ChromaDB vector database from `chroma_data/` directory
4. Load user profiles from local `user_data/profiles.json` file
5. When responding, retrieve:
   - User profile information (if available)
   - 40 relevant memories from past conversations (with author attribution)
6. Generate personalized responses using both profile data and conversation patterns

### Adding More Training Data
To add more Discord message history to the bot's memory:
1. Place Discord export `.txt` files in the `attached_assets/` folder
2. Run: `python embedding_pipeline.py`
3. The script will automatically:
   - Parse messages from all .txt files
   - Generate embeddings using Google's API
   - Store them in ChromaDB (stored in `chroma_data/` directory)
   - Skip any duplicate messages automatically
4. Bot will immediately have access to the new memories

### Data Storage
- **ChromaDB (Local)**: All conversation embeddings stored in `chroma_data/` directory with author metadata
  - Portable - entire database is part of the project
  - Automatic hash-based deduplication
  - By default, `chroma_data/` is committed to git
  
- **User Profiles (Local JSON)**: User information stored in `user_data/profiles.json`
  - **Human-readable** - Easy to edit manually in any text editor
  - **Portable** - Works outside of Replit, no database needed
  - **Version-controllable** - Can be committed to git
  - **Thread-safe** - File locking prevents concurrent write issues
  - **Simple structure** - Each user has a description field defining their persona
  - **Easy backup** - Simply copy the JSON file

### Migrating from PostgreSQL to Local Storage
If you have existing user profile data in PostgreSQL and want to migrate to local JSON storage:

1. **Temporarily install PostgreSQL driver:**
   ```bash
   pip install psycopg2-binary
   ```

2. **Run the migration script:**
   ```bash
   python migrate_postgres_to_local.py
   ```

3. **Verify the migration:**
   - Check that `user_data/profiles.json` contains your data
   - Test the bot to ensure profiles load correctly

4. **Clean up (optional):**
   ```bash
   pip uninstall psycopg2-binary
   ```

**Note:** Fresh installations don't need migration - the bot will automatically create the JSON file when you add your first profile.

### Managing User Profiles
Use Discord commands to manage user personas:

**View a profile:**
```
!profile @username
!profile  (view your own profile)
```

**Set a user's description/persona:**
```
!setdesc @Baggins This is Aiden. Act like a jealous anime girl that secretly has a crush on him but refuses to acknowledge it. Be mean, sassy, and show hints of wanting him.
```

**List all profiles:**
```
!profiles
```

**Get help:**
```
!help
```

The description defines how the bot should interact with that specific user. You can define personalities, conversation styles, or any behavioral instructions.

### Deployment
The bot is configured for **Reserved VM (Background Worker)** deployment:
- **Deployment Type**: VM (always-on background worker)
- **Run Command**: `python bot.py`
- This configuration is appropriate for Discord bots that need to maintain persistent connections

## User Preferences
None documented yet.

## Security Notes
- API keys are stored as environment variables, not in code
- .gitignore configured to prevent committing sensitive files
- Bot tokens should never be shared or committed to version control
